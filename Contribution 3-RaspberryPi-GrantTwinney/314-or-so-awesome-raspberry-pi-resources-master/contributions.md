# Contributions

If you've anything to add (new resources, something you found really helpful or even created yourself), or fix (dead links, something inaccurate), you can do one of two things:

* [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) containing your proposed changes and I'll review as time permits.

* [Create an Issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) with your proposed changes or concerns and I'll review and, if applicable, incorporate them as time permits.

Thanks for helping out!
